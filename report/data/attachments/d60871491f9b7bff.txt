How much do you know about the wine cabinet? Do you understand the difference between the thermoelectric wine cooler and the compressor wine cooler? And this article will take you to look at the two types of wine coolers as well as their differences.A wine cooler is an appliance that imitates the natural storage conditions of wine, and it can also be a small bionic wine cellar, which is different from the wine cabinet that is usually for the display of wine. The wine cooler is used for storing wine. Because the wine cooler is in constant temperature, it is also called the constant temperature wine cabinet.The electric wine cabinet can be divided into the thermoelectric wine cooler and compressor wine cooler. And the compressor wine cooler includes the direct cooling wine cooler and air cooling wine cooler.The thermoelectric wine cooler is a wine cabinet with semiconductor cooling chip thermoelectric refrigeration as the refrigeration system.Figure 2: A thermoelectric wine cooler for 8 bottles of wine.There are three common refrigeration methods, including vapour-compression refrigeration, absorption refrigeration, and thermoelectric refrigeration. Thermoelectric wine coolers generally adopt vapour-compression refrigeration and thermoelectric refrigeration systems.The DC thermoelectric cooler absorbs electric heat to cool inside the cabinet, and after a few minutes, there can be a small range on a layer of frost.A compressor wine cooler is the electric wine cabinet cooled by the refrigeration compressor. The refrigeration system consists of four basic components, including a compressor, a condenser, throttling parts, and an evaporator. The four components are connected into a closed system by the copper pipe in order, and the system is filled with a certain amount of refrigerant.Figure 3: The refrigeration system includes a compressor, a condenser, a expansion valve, and an evaporator.In general, if you need to store your wine of various kinds for a long time, you should choose the compressor wine cooler. But if you only want temporary storage, you can choose the thermoelectric wine cooler. The thermoelectric wine cooler is generally in small volume and with small capacity, while the compressor wine cooler is in larger volume, and with multi-capacity storage. The thermoelectric wine cooler is delicate and light, while the compressor wine cooler is heavy and thick.The thermoelectric wine cooler can only achieve the temperature control of 10-18 ℃. But the compressor wine cooler can achieve temperature control of 5-22 ℃. The compressor wine cooler is little affected by the external environment temperature, but the temperature difference between the surface and the interior of the thermoelectric wine cooler is limited.Therefore, the compressor wine cooler is more suitable for storing all kinds of wine, which is more practical, within a more accurate controllable temperature scale, and less affected by the environment.A compressor wine cooler applies a refrigeration compressor system. However, a thermoelectric wine cooler uses a thermoelectric cooling method, electrifying the refrigeration chip to produce air that separates the hot and cold air. As a result, the cold air remains in the wine cabinet, while the hot air is discharged to the outside through a fan.Figure 4: A thermoelectric cooler.We have summarized the difference between the thermoelectric wine cooler and the compressor wine cooler here.

', 'content': "<p>Figure 1: Adding oil to the air compressor.With the improvement of the industry and people's living standards, the requirements for industrial products have also been greatly increased. At the same time, the upgrade of the air compression system has promoted higher requirements for the oil content, water content, and decibel of the compressed gas. In response to market demand, the application of oil-free air compressors was born, and it is popular with the general public. What are their pros? Please keep reading, and you will get it.Air filterHigh-efficiency paper cylinder type intake can filter dust and particles.Automatic adjustmentWhen the required pressure is reached, the compressor will stop automatically to save energy.Mute coverIt reduces noise, so the compressor can be installed near the place of use.Human-machine interfaceIt is used to monitor alarm alerts, maintenance plans and to view operations online.Coolers and PipesLarge-size coolers greatly increase unit performance.Energy-efficiency rotorAs an air-cooled scrolling type rotor, it has the advantages of long service life, stability, and good energy efficiency.Figure 2: A rotor of the air compressor.There is no metal contact between the compression scrolls and no oil lubrication in the compression chamber. Therefore, the working principle ensures clean oil-free compressed air. The oil-free scroll compressor is of high efficiency, using a simple start and stop control, which lacks the loss of unloading power. Scroll compressors are designed with fewer moving parts and to operate for long periods.Because the lubricating oil is very sticky, most oil filters cannot completely remove it. However, for the oil-free and water-lubricated air compressor, there is no oil during the whole compression process, which can ensure high-quality gas.Before the appearance of high-quality oil-free screw compressors, some water removal equipment would lose its function due to the oil produced in the compressed air during operation. In addition, now a lot of free dryers, no heat regenerative adsorption dryers, and other water removal equipment on the market, whose water removal efficiency is gradually reduced due to the oil in the compressed air. But the water-lubricated oil-free screw air compressor provides 100% oil-free gas after compression, which not only fully protects the water removal equipment but also reduces the cost caused by its maintenance.Figure 3: The process of a no heat regenerative adsorption dryer.The oil-free water-lubricated air compressor will not reduce the load of the motor due to the pressure loss caused by the oil filter to save energy.At present, the quality tertiary filter in its use process will lose 1 to 1.2 kg pressure. If a screw compressor increases 1 kg of pressure, there will be 7% of power loss. For instance, a 50p air compressor works for 10 hours each day, 26 kWh will be wasted.Figure 4: A water-lubricated oil-free air compressor.Air compressors need to use lubricating oil to ensure high-efficiency operation. But oil-free compressors can use other lubricants to replace the lubricating oil, so as to greatly reduce the use of the oil.The oil-free air compressor is capable of saving the cost of lubricating oil. Take a 37KW oil-free air compressor as an example, it consumes 20 kilograms of lubricating oil every 2500 hours at least, and 60 kg of oil will be increased in a year.In addition, to remove the oil in the compressed air, a high-efficiency oil filter is required whose core needs to be replaced many times. The more the filters, the greater the pressure drop. From this point of view, an oil-free air compressor can solve many problems that occur in an oil compressor.The use and maintenance of the oil-free air compressor are also simple and convenient, which can improve work efficiency and accelerate the speed of production. As is known to us all, the regular maintenance of the oil air compressor, including replacing the head and adding lubricating oil, takes time and cost, which relatively increases the user's workload. Both two types of compressors are basically the same in functions and are very suitable for use in the food and medicine industry, and asepsis laboratories.Figure 5: Two workers are maintaining the air compressor.The material of the oil-free scroll air compressor does not contain oil-based substances, and there is no need to add the lubricating oil during the operation, so it greatly improves the quality of the discharge, which adds a layer of protection to the equipment matched by users. Unlike the screw air compressor, the normal compressor discharges the gas containing a large number of oil molecules. It will bring pollution and corrosion to the equipment and products produced by users, so the choice of the oil-free silent air compressor is the guarantee of air quality.It can be concluded that on the premise of comprehensive consideration of enterprise production requirements, water-lubricated oil-free screw air compressors have the advantages of energy-saving, pollution reduction, and fewer costs. At present, the oil-free compressors on the market can be divided into screw compressors, piston compressors, and scroll compressors. Among them, oil-free screw air compressors are more used in pure compressed air industry applications thanks to their oil-zero characteristics.*We’ll never share your email address with a third-party.support@okmarts.comservice@okmarts.com</p>", 'createBy': 'test', 'validStatus_dictText': '有效', 'validStatus': 1, 'createTime': '2022-03-17 13:55:38', 'updateBy': None, 'hotIs': 0, 'id': '1504335631209435137'}, {'titleDescribe': "                With the improvement of the industry and people's living standards, the requirements for industrial products            ", 'titleImg': 'https://okmarts.com/pub/media/magefan_blog/202107/A thermoelectric cooler-min.png', 'updateTime': None, 'hotIs_dictText': '是', 'title': '                What’s the Difference between Thermoelectric and Compressor Wine Coolers?

As we know, there are a lot of kinds of them, such as double-door, multi-door, and other types.For instance, the LG double door refrigerator with a bright appearance and strong performance is outstanding among similar refrigerator products. However, many people are troubled with dealing with failures in their use. In fact, for household appliances, it's also useful to know something about emergencies.So, let’s start to look at the reasons and solutions for the cooling failure.When the refrigerator is not cooling, you should first check whether the connection of the power supply is normal and if the light inside the refrigerator is normal. Besides, you can further use an electric pen for testing. If the power supply and the lamp are both normal, but the fridge cannot be started, you should call the after-sales for help. Of course, if the refrigerator has a compensation switch, you should see if it is turned on when the ambient temperature is below 16 ℃.First, you could hear if the compressor is working properly. The compressor would make a small vibration sound when working normally. In case that the high-pressure output buffer pipe in the compressor is broken, or the screw that is used to fix the pipe is loose, the high-pressure pipe will not exhaust, and the low-pressure pipe will not suction. It’s the reason why the compressor is running, but not for refrigeration. In addition, the lack of oil in the internal parts of the compressor will be one of the causes, which will make a large noise when the compressor starts. In this case, the compressor can be filled with the lubricating oil for 30- 50 ml. And if the compressor is out of service for a long time but stored improperly, the internal parts will rust due to dampness, and it will be difficult to start the compressor.Figure 2: LG Compressor BMA082HAMVCheck the refrigerant in the fridge. The method is to run the refrigerator for 3-5 minutes and then cut off the power supply. You can hear the sound of water running. If it is silent, it means that the refrigerant has been used up or leaked fully. Under this circumstance, the compressor still runs, but the fridge cannot cool due to a lack of refrigerant for evaporation and heat absorption in the refrigeration system.The capillary blockage will lead to the refrigerant failing to enter the evaporator to absorb heat and play its role, causing the temperature of the refrigerator to remain high.Figure 3: The capillary of the refrigerator is clogged.The refrigeration process varies by type of refrigerator. If it’s a frost-free system with cooling failure, you can check whether the fan is running normally. The refrigerator has the freezer on the top and the refrigerator on the bottom. Open the freezer door, hold the button at the edge of the box which controls indoor lighting when the door is opened and stops the fan. Then you should check if the fan is working.A direct cooling refrigerator adopts the double circuit. After checking its normal working current, the maintenance worker found the temperature of the condenser was lower than normal. And he opened the freezer to check. It proved that the evaporator was not frosting, and the second capillary felt cool, but there was no refrigerant flowing sound. It could be the second capillary blockage.Figure 4: The freezer of a fridge.To judge whether it was ice clogging or dirty blocking, the worker covered the second capillary tube with a hot towel, and there was no change after half an hour, so it was judged to be dirty blocking. Disconnect the welding between the secondary capillary tube and the solenoid valve, and it was found that there was gas exhausted from the side of the solenoid valve, but no gas from the capillary side. At this time, the maintenance worker sealed the solenoid valve side outlet, disconnected the compressor process tube, then welded it in the repaired valve, and then filled in 0.6Mpa of nitrogen to blow off the capillary, but it was invalid. And then he pressurized it to 0.8Mpa, the gas suddenly ejected, which meant that the dirty blocking had been solved. Figure 5: A LG double door refrigerator.There is a situation where the compressor starts again less than 3 minutes after stopping, and the high and low pressures in the cooling system have not yet reached equilibrium. Given this case, note that the door should be opened as little as possible after the compressor is stopped, and the time should be shortened. At the same time, it is not advisable to put much food in the refrigerator, and put items with higher temperatures. Ensure that the time for the temperature in the box to rise to the start-up temperature of the compressor is longer than 3 minutes, and it will not affect the next start-up.If the refrigerator is not cooling, the food, meat, and fruits stored in it will quickly become moldy, especially in summer. Under normal circumstances, when household appliances have been used for a long time, some problems will inevitably occur. In case of encountering failures of using the fridge, you should first check the external problem, that is, the power supply.

At present, piston refrigeration compressors are mostly used in small and medium-sized cold storage refrigeration systems. Because of the different refrigerating mediums, the compressors are often divided into ammonia type and fluorine type. This article will introduce to you common faults and ideas of piston ammonia refrigeration compressors.Figure 2: Mitsubishi Compressor ANB52FKFMT* Maintenance MethodsFirst, you should test whether the supply voltage is too low, or the connection of the motor line is poor. If the grid voltage is low, you can start the compressor again after the grid voltage is restored to normal. If the line connection is bad, you should examine and repair the connection between the line and the motor.You should inspect if the exhaust valve plate leaks. If the exhaust valve plate or the seal is damaged, the leakage will cause the pressure in the crankcase to be high, resulting in the failure of starting normally. You should replace the exhaust valve plate and sealing.You then check if the energy regulating mechanism is out of order. It mainly includes the check of the oil supply pipeline, the pressure, and the oil piston.You then check if the energy regulation mechanism is out of order, which mainly includes the oil supply pipeline, the pressure, and the oil piston. And you can repair it according to the causes.You should examine the condition of the temperature controller. If it is maladjusted, you should adjust it. If it is damaged, repair or replace it. At last, you can inspect the pressure relay. After repairing the pressure relay, you should reset the pressure parameters.* Maintenance WaysYou should check if there is oil leakage at the connection of the oil pump pipeline system or at the blockage. You can tighten joints. If it is blocked, dredge the oil pipeline.You should figure out that the large opening degree of the oil pressure regulating valve or the fallen core leads to oil pressure failure.If the oil pressure regulating valve is not properly adjusted, you should adjust the oil pressure to the required value. If the core falls off, it is necessary to re-install it and tighten it firmly.Insufficient oil or ammonia liquid in the crankcase will cause the oil pump to fail to feed oil. To troubleshoot it, you can add oil, or stop the compressor and eliminate ammonia liquid.The oil pump is seriously worn and the clearance is extremely large, resulting in low oil pressure. In this case, you should repair the oil pump, or replace it when the fault is serious.Check the connecting rod bearing bush, spindle bush, small head bushing, and a piston pin. If they are worn seriously, you should replace the relevant parts in time.Figure 3: The connecting rod bearing.The gasket of the rear end cover of the crankcase is misplaced, blocking the oil inlet channel of the oil pump. The gasket should be disassembled and checked, and its position should be fixed again.* MaintenanceThe shaft and bush are not appropriately assembled, leading to extremely small clearance. You should adjust the clearance to make it meet the requirements.There are impurities in the lubricating oil making the bush rough. In this case, you should scrap the bearing bush first, and then replace it with the new oil. But if the bush is seriously rough, you should replace it. The shaft sealing ring is installed tightly. You should adjust it to a proper position. And you can replace a new friction ring according to its condition.If the high oil temperature is caused by the high suction and exhaust temperature of the compressor, you should properly adjust the liquid supply valve of the system to make the suction and exhaust temperature return to normal.Figure 4: A crankcase.* Maintenance MethodsYou should check if the clearance between the connecting rod bush and the crankshaft journal is too large. If so, you can take measures to make the gap small or directly replace it with a new bush.If the clearance between the main bearing and the main shaft journal is too large, causing collision and friction and making a sound. They should be repaired or replaced.Inspect whether the split pin is broken and the connecting rod nut is loose. If so, replace the split pin and tighten the connecting rod nut.If the coupling or the key of the coupling has faults, you should adjust the coupling or maintain the key or replace a new key.The main bearing steel ball is worn, and the bearing frame is fractured. In this case, replace the new bearing.Figure 5: The compressor cylinder internal structure.* Maintenance WaysYou should check the oil pump that may cause the oil pressure to be too low or the oil circuit to be blocked. To solve it, shut down the compressor for a comprehensive overhaul.Inspect whether the clearance between the piston and the cylinder wall is too small or the piston deviates. The solution is to adjust the piston.The seal of the safety block or the false cover is not tight, resulting in a mixture of high- and low-pressure. You should take measures to improve the sealing performance.Check whether the suction temperature is too high. Adjust it to lower the temperature.If it’s the bad lubricating oil of small viscosity that leads to the high temperature, you should stop the machine to replace the new lubricating oil.Examine the cooling water jacket to know if the scale is too thick or the water is insufficient. You can remove the scale in time, or add the cooling water.Inspect the conditions of the suction and exhaust valve plates. If damaged, they should be replaced in time.Check whether the piston ring has been seriously worn. If so, replace a new one.Figure 6: Six steps to replace the oil seal of the compressor.* Maintenance WaysCheck whether the shaft seal assembly fails to meet the requirements. Check whether the friction surface between the moving ring and the fixed ring has been rough. If it’s extraordinarily rough, you should carefully ground and reassemble the sealing surface.The rubber-sealed loop is aging or the tightness is not set appropriately, which will lead to oil leakage. In this case, you should replace it with a new rubber sealed loop and adjust it to the appropriate tightness.Check whether the spring of the shaft seal is weakened in spring force, resulting in the oil leakage of the shaft seal. You should remove the original spring and replace it with a new spring of the same size.The sealing performance of the back of the fixing ring and the shaft seal gland is worse. To troubleshoot it, you should remove the fixing ring and clean and reassemble the back ring.Adjust the crankcase pressure to the normal value. But before stopping the machine, you should lower the pressure of the crankcase first and check the exhaust valve for leakage.*We’ll never share your email address with a third-party.support@okmarts.comservice@okmarts.com</p>', 'createBy': 'test', 'validStatus_dictText': '有效', 'validStatus': 1, 'createTime': '2022-03-17 13:52:33', 'updateBy': None, 'hotIs': 0, 'id': '1504334851953889282'}, {'titleDescribe': '                In the refrigeration system of the cold storage, the refrigeration compressor is the core equipment.

Thermoelectric wine coolers generally adopt vapour-compression refrigeration and thermoelectric refrigeration systems.The DC thermoelectric cooler absorbs electric heat to cool inside the cabinet, and after a few minutes, there can be a small range on a layer of frost.A compressor wine cooler is the electric wine cabinet cooled by the refrigeration compressor. The refrigeration system consists of four basic components, including a compressor, a condenser, throttling parts, and an evaporator. The four components are connected into a closed system by the copper pipe in order, and the system is filled with a certain amount of refrigerant.Figure 3: The refrigeration system includes a compressor, a condenser, a expansion valve, and an evaporator.In general, if you need to store your wine of various kinds for a long time, you should choose the compressor wine cooler. But if you only want temporary storage, you can choose the thermoelectric wine cooler. The thermoelectric wine cooler is generally in small volume and with small capacity, while the compressor wine cooler is in larger volume, and with multi-capacity storage. The thermoelectric wine cooler is delicate and light, while the compressor wine cooler is heavy and thick.The thermoelectric wine cooler can only achieve the temperature control of 10-18 ℃. But the compressor wine cooler can achieve temperature control of 5-22 ℃. The compressor wine cooler is little affected by the external environment temperature, but the temperature difference between the surface and the interior of the thermoelectric wine cooler is limited.Therefore, the compressor wine cooler is more suitable for storing all kinds of wine, which is more practical, within a more accurate controllable temperature scale, and less affected by the environment.A compressor wine cooler applies a refrigeration compressor system. However, a thermoelectric wine cooler uses a thermoelectric cooling method, electrifying the refrigeration chip to produce air that separates the hot and cold air. As a result, the cold air remains in the wine cabinet, while the hot air is discharged to the outside through a fan.Figure 4: A thermoelectric cooler.We have summarized the difference between the thermoelectric wine cooler and the compressor wine cooler here.

A compressor is key to improve the performance of your refrigerator. During the refrigeration cycle, it allows the refrigerant to flow through the refrigerator coils. Do you know its working principle? The refrigeration system of the fridge is composed of 4 indispensable parts, including a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve, and an evaporator. According to the control or the use, it can also be installed with auxiliary devices such as the controller of pressure, temperature, and the dry filter.Figure 2: The refrigeration system of the fridge, including an expansion valve, heat exchange coils, the refrigerant, and a compressor.During the working process, the gaseous refrigerant is compressed into the gas with a high temperature and high pressure through the compressor and then enters the condenser. The condenser is equivalent to a heat exchanger, which converts the high-temperature and high-pressure gaseous refrigerant into low-temperature and high-pressure liquid refrigerant.Figure 3: Gaseous refrigerants, including R134a, R22, R424a, etc.After that, the liquid refrigerant flows through the expansion valve, which is a throttling device. The pressure of the refrigerant drops after coming out of the expansion valve, and its temperature continues to fall, becoming two phases of the gas and liquid. The expansion valve of the fridge is generally the capillary, in which the refrigerant suddenly flows from a larger one to a smaller one, so as to throttle it.Then the refrigerant enters into the evaporator for heat exchange and gasification. As a result, it becomes high-temperature and low-pressure gaseous refrigerant back to the compressor to continue circulation.Figure 4: A heat exchanger.If the overall appearance of the refrigerator is OK, and the copper pipes in the freezer haven't been repaired, you should repair the compressor.Is the compressor in the refrigerator worth replacing?Compressors can fail if there are high voltages, dirty coils, excessive refrigerant, and insufficient lubrication.In some cases, your compressor may be damaged, which makes your refrigerator fail to work. So you may choose to replace the compressor or buy a new fridge. You then would find it difficult to make a decision, considering the cost of money and time.Figure 5: A refrigerator fulled with foods.Therefore, we give you some suggestions on replacing the compressor or the refrigerator.The refrigerant type is an important factor to consider. If your refrigerator uses R12 or R22, which now are not sold on the market. So you’d better buy a new fridge.A high-quality refrigerator compressor will cost much. Some of them may cost half the price of a new refrigerator, depending on the capacitor and whether you want to buy a new one.As we know, compressors are damaged due to failures in the refrigeration system. And you should repair these faults to make the new compressor serve long, leading to additional cost.In addition, if your fridge is under warranty, it can be free to repair.Figure 6: The maintenance worker is replacing the compressor of the fridge.Many people think that fridges will work forever, but it’s the truth that the lifespan of a refrigerator relies on cooling efficiency. Besides, it also depends on the brand of the refrigerator, the use, and maintenance. Having known the service life of your fridge, you will understand if it’s necessary to repair it or buy a new one. Lots of refrigerators can perform well for around 10 years. If your refrigerator has a short life, replacing the appliance should be a better choice.Because the price of a compressor is high, which is close to half of that of a new fridge.

At present, piston refrigeration compressors are mostly used in small and medium-sized cold storage refrigeration systems. Because of the different refrigerating mediums, the compressors are often divided into ammonia type and fluorine type. This article will introduce to you common faults and ideas of piston ammonia refrigeration compressors.Figure 2: Mitsubishi Compressor ANB52FKFMT* Maintenance MethodsFirst, you should test whether the supply voltage is too low, or the connection of the motor line is poor. If the grid voltage is low, you can start the compressor again after the grid voltage is restored to normal. If the line connection is bad, you should examine and repair the connection between the line and the motor.You should inspect if the exhaust valve plate leaks. If the exhaust valve plate or the seal is damaged, the leakage will cause the pressure in the crankcase to be high, resulting in the failure of starting normally. You should replace the exhaust valve plate and sealing.You then check if the energy regulating mechanism is out of order. It mainly includes the check of the oil supply pipeline, the pressure, and the oil piston.You then check if the energy regulation mechanism is out of order, which mainly includes the oil supply pipeline, the pressure, and the oil piston. And you can repair it according to the causes.You should examine the condition of the temperature controller. If it is maladjusted, you should adjust it. If it is damaged, repair or replace it. At last, you can inspect the pressure relay. After repairing the pressure relay, you should reset the pressure parameters.* Maintenance WaysYou should check if there is oil leakage at the connection of the oil pump pipeline system or at the blockage. You can tighten joints. If it is blocked, dredge the oil pipeline.You should figure out that the large opening degree of the oil pressure regulating valve or the fallen core leads to oil pressure failure.If the oil pressure regulating valve is not properly adjusted, you should adjust the oil pressure to the required value. If the core falls off, it is necessary to re-install it and tighten it firmly.Insufficient oil or ammonia liquid in the crankcase will cause the oil pump to fail to feed oil. To troubleshoot it, you can add oil, or stop the compressor and eliminate ammonia liquid.The oil pump is seriously worn and the clearance is extremely large, resulting in low oil pressure. In this case, you should repair the oil pump, or replace it when the fault is serious.Check the connecting rod bearing bush, spindle bush, small head bushing, and a piston pin. If they are worn seriously, you should replace the relevant parts in time.Figure 3: The connecting rod bearing.The gasket of the rear end cover of the crankcase is misplaced, blocking the oil inlet channel of the oil pump. The gasket should be disassembled and checked, and its position should be fixed again.* MaintenanceThe shaft and bush are not appropriately assembled, leading to extremely small clearance. You should adjust the clearance to make it meet the requirements.There are impurities in the lubricating oil making the bush rough. In this case, you should scrap the bearing bush first, and then replace it with the new oil. But if the bush is seriously rough, you should replace it. The shaft sealing ring is installed tightly. You should adjust it to a proper position. And you can replace a new friction ring according to its condition.If the high oil temperature is caused by the high suction and exhaust temperature of the compressor, you should properly adjust the liquid supply valve of the system to make the suction and exhaust temperature return to normal.Figure 4: A crankcase.* Maintenance MethodsYou should check if the clearance between the connecting rod bush and the crankshaft journal is too large. If so, you can take measures to make the gap small or directly replace it with a new bush.If the clearance between the main bearing and the main shaft journal is too large, causing collision and friction and making a sound. They should be repaired or replaced.Inspect whether the split pin is broken and the connecting rod nut is loose. If so, replace the split pin and tighten the connecting rod nut.If the coupling or the key of the coupling has faults, you should adjust the coupling or maintain the key or replace a new key.The main bearing steel ball is worn, and the bearing frame is fractured. In this case, replace the new bearing.Figure 5: The compressor cylinder internal structure.* Maintenance WaysYou should check the oil pump that may cause the oil pressure to be too low or the oil circuit to be blocked. To solve it, shut down the compressor for a comprehensive overhaul.Inspect whether the clearance between the piston and the cylinder wall is too small or the piston deviates. The solution is to adjust the piston.The seal of the safety block or the false cover is not tight, resulting in a mixture of high- and low-pressure. You should take measures to improve the sealing performance.Check whether the suction temperature is too high. Adjust it to lower the temperature.If it’s the bad lubricating oil of small viscosity that leads to the high temperature, you should stop the machine to replace the new lubricating oil.Examine the cooling water jacket to know if the scale is too thick or the water is insufficient. You can remove the scale in time, or add the cooling water.Inspect the conditions of the suction and exhaust valve plates. If damaged, they should be replaced in time.Check whether the piston ring has been seriously worn. If so, replace a new one.Figure 6: Six steps to replace the oil seal of the compressor.* Maintenance WaysCheck whether the shaft seal assembly fails to meet the requirements. Check whether the friction surface between the moving ring and the fixed ring has been rough. If it’s extraordinarily rough, you should carefully ground and reassemble the sealing surface.The rubber-sealed loop is aging or the tightness is not set appropriately, which will lead to oil leakage. In this case, you should replace it with a new rubber sealed loop and adjust it to the appropriate tightness.Check whether the spring of the shaft seal is weakened in spring force, resulting in the oil leakage of the shaft seal. You should remove the original spring and replace it with a new spring of the same size.The sealing performance of the back of the fixing ring and the shaft seal gland is worse. To troubleshoot it, you should remove the fixing ring and clean and reassemble the back ring.Adjust the crankcase pressure to the normal value. But before stopping the machine, you should lower the pressure of the crankcase first and check the exhaust valve for leakage.*We’ll never share your email address with a third-party.support@okmarts.comservice@okmarts.com</p>', 'createBy': 'test', 'validStatus_dictText': '有效', 'validStatus': 1, 'createTime': '2022-03-17 13:49:26', 'updateBy': None, 'hotIs': 0, 'id': '1504334069040910338'}, {'titleDescribe': '                Almost all families have their own refrigerators, and Samsung fridges have been outstanding.

As we know, there are a lot of kinds of them, such as double-door, multi-door, and other types.For instance, the LG double door refrigerator with a bright appearance and strong performance is outstanding among similar refrigerator products. However, many people are troubled with dealing with failures in their use. In fact, for household appliances, it's also useful to know something about emergencies.So, let’s start to look at the reasons and solutions for the cooling failure.When the refrigerator is not cooling, you should first check whether the connection of the power supply is normal and if the light inside the refrigerator is normal. Besides, you can further use an electric pen for testing. If the power supply and the lamp are both normal, but the fridge cannot be started, you should call the after-sales for help. Of course, if the refrigerator has a compensation switch, you should see if it is turned on when the ambient temperature is below 16 ℃.First, you could hear if the compressor is working properly. The compressor would make a small vibration sound when working normally. In case that the high-pressure output buffer pipe in the compressor is broken, or the screw that is used to fix the pipe is loose, the high-pressure pipe will not exhaust, and the low-pressure pipe will not suction. It’s the reason why the compressor is running, but not for refrigeration. In addition, the lack of oil in the internal parts of the compressor will be one of the causes, which will make a large noise when the compressor starts. In this case, the compressor can be filled with the lubricating oil for 30- 50 ml. And if the compressor is out of service for a long time but stored improperly, the internal parts will rust due to dampness, and it will be difficult to start the compressor.Figure 2: LG Compressor BMA082HAMVCheck the refrigerant in the fridge. The method is to run the refrigerator for 3-5 minutes and then cut off the power supply. You can hear the sound of water running. If it is silent, it means that the refrigerant has been used up or leaked fully. Under this circumstance, the compressor still runs, but the fridge cannot cool due to a lack of refrigerant for evaporation and heat absorption in the refrigeration system.The capillary blockage will lead to the refrigerant failing to enter the evaporator to absorb heat and play its role, causing the temperature of the refrigerator to remain high.Figure 3: The capillary of the refrigerator is clogged.The refrigeration process varies by type of refrigerator. If it’s a frost-free system with cooling failure, you can check whether the fan is running normally. The refrigerator has the freezer on the top and the refrigerator on the bottom. Open the freezer door, hold the button at the edge of the box which controls indoor lighting when the door is opened and stops the fan. Then you should check if the fan is working.A direct cooling refrigerator adopts the double circuit. After checking its normal working current, the maintenance worker found the temperature of the condenser was lower than normal. And he opened the freezer to check. It proved that the evaporator was not frosting, and the second capillary felt cool, but there was no refrigerant flowing sound. It could be the second capillary blockage.Figure 4: The freezer of a fridge.To judge whether it was ice clogging or dirty blocking, the worker covered the second capillary tube with a hot towel, and there was no change after half an hour, so it was judged to be dirty blocking. Disconnect the welding between the secondary capillary tube and the solenoid valve, and it was found that there was gas exhausted from the side of the solenoid valve, but no gas from the capillary side. At this time, the maintenance worker sealed the solenoid valve side outlet, disconnected the compressor process tube, then welded it in the repaired valve, and then filled in 0.6Mpa of nitrogen to blow off the capillary, but it was invalid. And then he pressurized it to 0.8Mpa, the gas suddenly ejected, which meant that the dirty blocking had been solved. Figure 5: A LG double door refrigerator.There is a situation where the compressor starts again less than 3 minutes after stopping, and the high and low pressures in the cooling system have not yet reached equilibrium. Given this case, note that the door should be opened as little as possible after the compressor is stopped, and the time should be shortened. At the same time, it is not advisable to put much food in the refrigerator, and put items with higher temperatures. Ensure that the time for the temperature in the box to rise to the start-up temperature of the compressor is longer than 3 minutes, and it will not affect the next start-up.If the refrigerator is not cooling, the food, meat, and fruits stored in it will quickly become moldy, especially in summer. Under normal circumstances, when household appliances have been used for a long time, some problems will inevitably occur. In case of encountering failures of using the fridge, you should first check the external problem, that is, the power supply.
